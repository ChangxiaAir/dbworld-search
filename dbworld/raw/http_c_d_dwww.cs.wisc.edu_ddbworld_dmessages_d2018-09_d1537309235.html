      <td colspan="2"> <p>The Computer Science department at The College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University (CSB/SJU) invites applications for a tenure-track position at the Assistant Professor level to begin Fall 2019.<br><br>The department currently includes five faculty members, a scientist-in-residence and a lab manager. The department will be relocating to newly renovated facilities with dedicated learning spaces that are managed by our lab manager and maintained by IT Services which provides extensive educational and system administration support for the department. We offer a major and minor in Computer Science as well as a major in Numerical Computation. For the past two years, we have been graduating around 30 majors annually.<br><br>Successful candidates<br>(1) must hold a PhD/ABD in Computer Science or a closely-related discipline or a Master's in Computer Science and PhD in another discipline (PhD preferred and required for tenure)<br>(2) must demonstrate commitment to undergraduate education and scholarship in the liberal arts tradition,<br>(3) must demonstrate willingness to work collaboratively, such as on class and lab design, and<br>(4) must demonstrate interest in working with students from diverse backgrounds.<br>&nbsp;<br>All areas in Computer Science are welcome. Preference will be given to candidates interested in and able to teach a wide range of courses throughout the curriculum to majors as well as non-majors and to mentor student research. Candidates able to complement existing expertise in the department are strongly encouraged to apply. The department is currently going through a transitional period due to retirements making this a great opportunity for the right candidate to influence the future trajectory of the department.<br><br>The College of Saint Benedict (CSB), a liberal arts college for women, and Saint John's University (SJU), a liberal arts college for men, are located in the central lakes area of Minnesota, surrounded by more than 3,000 acres of pristine forests, prairies, and lakes. The campuses are minutes away from St. Cloud, an increasingly diverse regional center with a population of over 100,000, and 70 miles from Minneapolis and St. Paul. &nbsp;Some CSB/SJU faculty and staff choose to reside locally, while others commute from the Twin Cities.&nbsp; Both St. Cloud and the Twin Cities offer a wide range of fine arts, cultural, dining, recreational, and sporting opportunities.<br>&nbsp;<br>CSB/SJU are Catholic colleges in the Benedictine tradition enlivened by values of community, hospitality, stewardship, and justice.&nbsp; The schools are dedicated to cultivating an equitable, inclusive community founded on respect for all persons. Students, staff and faculty from many diverse belief systems and backgrounds collectively bring a rich dimension to the academic, cultural, and religious experience at CSB/SJU. We welcome faculty who devote themselves with passion and integrity to their disciplines and to a transformative education of their students.<br>&nbsp;<br>With a total enrollment of approximately 3600 students, faculty members develop relationships with students in small classroom settings and have opportunities to work closely with students on research projects, experiential learning experiences, and study abroad programs. Recent initiatives to create a dynamic general education curriculum and to develop plans for a new teaching and learning center demonstrate strong institutional support for faculty development. CSB/SJU offer competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits program.</p> </td>
