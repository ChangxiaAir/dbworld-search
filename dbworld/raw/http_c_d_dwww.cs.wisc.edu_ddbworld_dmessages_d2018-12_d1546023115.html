*********************************************
CALL FOR PAPERS
*********************************************

The 11th International ACM Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES 2019) 
In-Cooperation with ACM, ACM SIGAPP and IFIP WG 2.6
<a href="http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES/19/">http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES/19/</a> 
November 12-14, 2019
Limassol, Cyprus

Description and Objectives
---------------------------
In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as individuals, organizations, services, software and applications sharing one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and inter-relationships among them. With the help of computational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties (such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital components", in which resources provided by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties platforms. 

As a result of their multi-disciplinary nature, digital ecosystems are highly complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems towards becoming innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-value, impacting business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources. 

The International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES) aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to the resource management of Digital Ecosystems and to examining how current approaches and technologies can be made to evolve and adapt to this end. MEDES 2019 calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results or novel ideas in all areas of emergent Digital EcoSystems. At the same time, the conference calls for short papers presenting interesting and exciting recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas that, although they might not be quite ready, will, however, preferably include a system demonstration.

Paper Submission
----------------
Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploaded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with the length limit will be rejected. 

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. Following the preliminary review notification date, the authors rebut by evidence and arguments all the reviewers? inquiries and their comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, the reviewers notify the authors of the final decision. Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and quality of presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present the paper. 

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM Digital Library and DBLP.
