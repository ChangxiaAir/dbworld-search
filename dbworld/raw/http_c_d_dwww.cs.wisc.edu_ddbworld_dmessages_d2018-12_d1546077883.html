Accepted papers will be submitted and published by IEEE Xplore?

The extended version of all presented papers will also be invited for the publication in International Scientific Journals(All 
indexed in SCOPUS/Web of Science/ECIE).?

10th International Workshop on "Tools and Techniques in Software Development Processes (TTSDP 2019)" will be held in conjunction
with the 2019 International Conference on Computational Sciences and Applications (ICCSA 2019). It is going to be held on during
July 1- 4, 2019 in Saint Petersburg, Russia in collaboration  with the Saint Petersburg University, Russia.

Submission deadline Feb 17, 2019.?

About the Workshop and Topics?

The Tools and Techniques in Software Development Processes (TTSDP 2019) provides a forum for researchers, and practitioners to 
share their new achievements, tools and techniques in field of software development process. TTSDP especially invites the 
experience papers from industry and academia, short papers, reports, surveys, working papers/work in progress and industrial reports.
Review/Comment papers are also welcome with the limitation that the paper should be on general problem/topic in the field (no comments
are allowed on a particular paper). TTSDP covers all the aspects of development process: process models, agile development, 
software engineering practices, requirements, system and design engineering including architectural design, software modeling,
 testing strategies and tactics, process and product metrics for each phase of software development, component based software 
engineering, software quality, verification and validation techniques and software project management.?

TTSDP 2019 invites you to submit your work that describes original and significant contribution in all area of software development 
process. The paper submitted to TTSDP 2019 must not submit elsewhere either in conference or journal and should be in IEEE style. 
Papers selected after peer review will be included in the conference proceedings and presented orally at the conference.?

TTSDP 2019 invites you to submit three different types of session papers (5 to 11 pages long) on all above-mentioned topics:?

Research papers: Papers that describes original and significant contribution in all area of software development process.?

Experience paper: papers from the field describing real-world experience related to software development process.?

Short paper and reports: Papers that allows the explanation of ideas that are not yet fully validated. Review articles (not on a 
particular paper), comparative study and survey reports are also welcome.?

The paper submitted to TTSDP 2019 must not have been submitted elsewhere either in conference or journal and must be in IEEE style. 
Papers selected after review will be included in the conference proceedings and presented orally at the conference.?

Publication?

All accepted workshop (TTSDP) papers will be included in proceeding of ICCSA 2019, published by IEEE Xplore. One of the authors of 
the accepted paper is required to register and expected to present the paper at the conference.Extended and modified version of all
accepted paper are invited to publish in various journals (all Web of Science/SCOPUS/ESCI indexed) including best papers in SCIE 
indexed Journal.?

Special ISSUES:?

In several countries, conference papers are not considered in evaluation of academic performances. In this point of view, we have decided 
to publish the extended version of all presented papers in TTSDP in special issues of several international journals. The papers will also 
be selected for International Journal of Software Science and Computational Intelligence (IJSSCI:Published by IGI global), International 
Journal of Open Source Software and Processes (IJOSSP) (IGI Global, USA), INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION (IJI-ESCI Indexed) and 
International Journal of Human Capital Information(IGI Global) with the condition that the papers should fall under the aim and scope 
of the said journals. Remaining papers will be accommodated in an international journal: CJICT (an Official Journal of Covenant University)
and in several other journals from renowned publishers such as - Inderscience, IGI etc.We are highly thankful to the Management/Editor/Editorial
committee of all these journals for accepting the special issues/papers from our workshops.?

A special issue of a SCIE Journal is confirmed for best papers of the software engineering symposiums and workshops@ICCSA 2019.
