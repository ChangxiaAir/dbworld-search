Symposia on "Computing in Companion Robots and Smart Toys"
----------------------------------------------------------
January 8 (Tuesday), 9:00AM  12:00NN
Room: PLUMERIA 2 

The goal of this symposium is to crystallize the emerging computing technologies 
and trends into positive efforts to focus on companion robots and smart toys such 
as Softbank Pepper, Honda Asimo, ASUS Zenbo, Mattel Hello Barbie, Google Toy and 
CogniToys Smart Dinosaur. The panel discussion will provide clear evidence that
computing technologies are playing an ever-increasing important and critical role 
in supporting companion robots and smart toys, which is an emerging discipline
in computer science and information systems. It is also expected that this symposia 
will further investigate new best practices and directions in sociotechnical systems.
