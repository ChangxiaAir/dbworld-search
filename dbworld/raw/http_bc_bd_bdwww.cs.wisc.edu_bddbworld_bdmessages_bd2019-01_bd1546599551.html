16th International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases (SSTD 2019)
==========================================================================

Location: Vienna, Austria
Date: August 19-21, 2019
URL: <A HREF="http://www.sstd2019.org">http://www.sstd2019.org</A>

The International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases 2019 (SSTD 2019) is the sixteenth event of a series of biannual symposia that discuss new and exciting research in spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal data management and related technologies with the goal to set future research directions. The primary focus of SSTD symposia is on original results in the areas of theoretical foundations, design, implementation, and applications of spatial and temporal database technology. SSTD also welcomes experience reports from application specialists and the commercial community that describe lessons learned in the development, operation, and maintenance of actual systems in practical and innovative applications. The goal is to exchange research ideas and results across academia, industry and government from diverse geographies, and career stages.

SSTD 2019 solicits submissions in four tracks.

Research track:
Authors are invited to submit long research papers that present original research contributions. The selection criteria include quality, novelty, correctness, and relevance to SSTD. Authors are also invited to submit short research papers that discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper. In particular, novel but significant proposals will be considered for acceptance to this category despite not having gone through sufficient experimental validation or lacking strong theoretical foundation.

Demo track:
Authors are invited to submit demo papers, describing demonstrations of systems, developed or under development. The selection criteria for the demonstration proposals include: the novelty, the technical advances and challenges, and the overall practical attractiveness of the demonstrated system.

Industry track:
Authors are invited to submit industry papers that describe original experiences, challenges, systems and applications in industry.

Vision track:
Authors are invited to submit vision papers that describe revolutionary ideas that are likely to guide research in the near future, challenge existing assumptions prevalent in the research community, or identify novel applications and technology trends that create new research challenges.

Topics of interest for all four tracks include, but are not limited to, the following in the context of spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal data:
  * Access Methods
  * AI and Machine Learning
  * Computational Geometry
  * Crowdsourcing and User-Generated Content
