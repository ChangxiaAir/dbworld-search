The 17th International Symposium on Database Programming Languages

Phoenix, Arizona, USA
June 23, 2019
hosted as part of PLDI 2019

Call for Papers

For over 25 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal venue for publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of databases and programming languages. Many key contributions in query languages for object-oriented data, persistent databases, nested relational data, and semistructured data, as well as fundamental ideas in types for query languages, were first announced at DBPL. Today, this creative research area is broadening into a subfield of data-centric computation, currently scattered among a range of venues. DBPL is an established destination for such new ideas and solicits submissions from researchers in databases, programming languages or any other community interested in the design, implementation or foundations of data-centric computation.


Scope
-----

DBPL solicits practical and theoretical papers in all topics at the intersection of databases and programming languages. Papers emphasizing new topics or emerging areas are especially
welcome. Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest for submissions include:

- Compiling Query Languages to Modern Hardware
- Data-Centric Programming Abstractions, Comprehensions, Monads
- Data Integration, Exchange, and Interoperability
- Data Synchronization and Bidirectional Transformations
- Declarative Data Centers (e.g., distributed query processing, serverless computing platforms, social computing platforms, etc)
- Emerging and Nontraditional Data Models
- Language-Based Security in Data Management
- Language-Integrated Query Mechanisms
- Managing Uncertain and Imprecise Information
- Metaprogramming and Heterogeneous Staged Computation
- Programming Language Support for Data-Centric Programming (e.g., databases, web programming, machine learning, etc)
- Query Compilation and In-memory Databases
- Query Language Design and Implementation
- Query Transformation and Optimization
- Schema Mapping and Metadata Management
- Semantics and Verification of Database Systems
- Stream Data Processing and Query Languages
- Type and Effect Systems for Data-Centric Programming



Author Guidelines
-----------------

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions should be no more than 10 pages long, excluding references, in the two-column ACM proceedings format, following PLDIâs formatting requirements (https://pldi19.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2019-papers#Call-for-Papers).

Each submission should begin with a succinct statement of the problem and a summary of the main results. Authors may provide more details to substantiate the main claims of the paper by including a clearly marked appendix at the end of the submission, which is not included in the page limit and is read at the discretion of the committee.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the symposium to present their work.

Short papers of at most 4 pages (same format as long papers) describing work in progress, demos, research challenges or visions are also welcome. Accepted short papers may be included or excluded from the formal proceedings, whichever the author(s) prefer.

Full and short papers are both due on the deadline, February 15, 2019.

Instructions on how to submit will be posted on the symposium website noted above.

Review is single-blind, so authors do not need to anonymize their submissions. PC submissions are allowed, except for the co-chairs.

History
-------

The 17th Symposium on Data Base Programming Languages (DBPL 2019) continues the tradition of excellence initiated by its predecessors in Roscoff, Finistere (1987), Salishan, Oregon (1989), Nafplion, Argolida (1991), Manhattan, New York (1993), Gubbio, Umbria (1995), Estes Park, Colorado (1997), Kinloch Rannoch, Scotland (1999), Marino, Rome (2001), Potsdam, Germany (2003), Trondheim, Norway (2005), Vienna, Austria (2007), Lyon, France (2009), Seattle, Washington (2011), Riva del Garda, Italy (2013), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (2015), Munich, Germany (2017). DBPL was affiliated with VLDB from 1999-2013 and in
2017. In 2015, it is affiliated with SPLASH for the first time and in 2019, it is affiliated with PLDI for the first time.
