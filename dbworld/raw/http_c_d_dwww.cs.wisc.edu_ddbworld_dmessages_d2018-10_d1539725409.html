10TH ANNUAL NON-VOLATILE MEMORIES WORKSHOP
University of California, San Diego, CA, USA
MARCH 10-12, 2019

The 10th Annual Non-Volatile Memories Workshop (NVMW 2019) provides a unique showcase for outstanding research on solid state, non-volatile memories, including devices, error coding, architectures, systems, theory, and applications. 

This year, the NVMW will present three awards, each of which includes a $1000 cash prize. We will award two Memorable Paper Awards recognizing the best student work published in the last 18 months. We will also present the Persistent Impact Prize to recognize high-impact research published more than 5 years ago.

Last year¡¯s workshop (NVMW 2018) included 40 speakers from top universities, industrial research labs, and device manufacturers and attracted nearly 230 attendees.

The organizing committee is soliciting presentations on any topic related to non-volatile, solid state memories.

Presentations may include new results or work that has already been published during the 18 months prior to the submission deadline. In lieu of printed proceedings, we will post the slides and extended abstracts of the presentations online.  Presentation of new work at the workshop does not preclude future publication.

Submissions to the workshops are 2-page extended abstracts.  They are due December 3rd, 2018 (AoE) with an automatic one week extension.
