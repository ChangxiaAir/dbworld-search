DESCRIPTION - TOPICS OF THE SYMPOSIUM:
--------------------------------------

This annual symposium series started years ago on Halkidiki, Greece, in 2011.
Since its start, the Symposium on Advanced Computation and Information
in Natural and Applied Sciences focusses on architectures and
methods for high end computational and numerical applications.
Up to date computing and information systems (software engineering,
communication, and architectures) as well as information
and knowledge focussed approches are indispensable tools
for progress in various scientific fields.

We invite scientists and engineers from academia and industry
using and implementing computation and information systems,
High Performance Computing, Cloud Computing, and Distributed Computing
as well as knowledge based and integrated approaches and
advanced applications for scientific research, engineering, education,
and future internet applications.

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished results
which are not under review in any other conference or journal,
to the peer review for publication and presentation, in the
following, but not limited to, the following topic areas
of this symposium.
