OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed 
Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for presenting the latest 
research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and the use of parallel and 
distributed systems for high-end computing. The 28th HPDC will take place in 
Phoenix, Arizona, United States on June 24-28, 2019 as part of FCRC.

SCOPE AND TOPICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submissions are welcomed on high-performance parallel and distributed computing 
(HPDC) topics including but not limited to: clouds, clusters, grids, big data, 
massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Experience reports of 
operational deployments that provide significantly novel insights for future 
research on HPDC applications and systems will also receive special 
consideration.

In the context of high-performance parallel and distributed computing, the 
topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Operating systems, networks, and architectures
* High performance runtime environments 
* Massively multicore systems, including heterogeneous systems
* Datacenter technology, resource virtualization
* Programming languages, APIs, and system interoperation approaches
* File and storage systems, I/O, and data management
* Big data stacks and big data ecosystems
* Resource management and scheduling, including energy-aware techniques
* Performance modeling, analysis, and engineering
* Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability
* Operational guarantees, risk assessment, and management
* Emerging application areas that include cloud/edge computing and IoT

PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most 12 pages in PDF 
format, including figures and references. Papers should be formatted in the ACM 
ACM Proceedings Style 
(<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html">http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html</A>) 
and submitted via the conference web site. Submitted papers must be original 
work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another 
conference or a journal.
