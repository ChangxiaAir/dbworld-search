The 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data 2018) will be held in Seattle, WA, Dec 10-13, 2018  
(<a href="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2018/index.html">http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2018/index.html</a> ), we would like to invite you to join this exciting event. 
We will have a very high  quality program. The highlights of the IEEE Big Data 2018 program are summarized as below 

(1)  High quality technical program:  99 regular papers selected from 518 full paper submissions 
from 1933 authors and co-authors at 49 countries.  (IEEE Big Data is a top-tier conference, 
regular paper acceptance rate has been less than 20% since its inception).
