The Digital Institute at Newcastle University has five openings in its Research Software Engineering Team.

We develop high-quality software in collaboration with scientists, engineers and scholars from all research domains. You will be responsible for delivering technical software engineering expertise across multiple simultaneous projects.

Whether this means scaling GPU rendering of city-scale models across thousands of nodes in the cloud, creating new digital editions to breathe new life into medieval texts, helping researchers gain insight into human movement by running gait analysis algorithms at scale, or working to help optimise the UK energy network ¨C we do it all.

We bring specialist programming expertise, modern development practices and engineering rigour to academic software. We provide expert software engineering consulting services to world-leading research&nbsp;teams,&nbsp;and collaborate with scientists and scholars to build software to meet the next generation of research challenges.
