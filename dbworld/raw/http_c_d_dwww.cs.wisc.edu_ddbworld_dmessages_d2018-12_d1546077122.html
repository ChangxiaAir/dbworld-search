in collaboration  with the Saint Petersburg University, Russia.?

Submission deadline: Feb 17, 2019?

About the Workshop and Topics?

Software Engineering Processes and Applications (SEPA: 2019) is aimed to provide a forum to
 scientists/researchers/engineers/practitioners and academicians to share their ideas, 
experiences and researches in the field of software engineering process and applications.
 SEPA 2019 covers all the frontier issues and trends in the modern software development 
processes. It includes process models, development process for different software platforms
 (e.g. social networks, cloud), process for adaptive, dependable, embedded, systems, 
agile development, software engineering practices, requirements, system and design 
engineering including architectural design, component level design, formal methods, 
software modeling, testing strategies and tactics, process and product metrics, 
Web Engineering, project management, risk management, and configuration management. 
SEPA also invite papers for the development process of the software/software systems
 in application areas e.g. agriculture, aviation industry, business, cyber-crime, 
education, government, military etc.?

SEPA invites you to submit theme papers that describe original and significant contribution
in all above-mentioned area of software engineering processes. The paper submitted to 
SEPA 2019 must not be submitted elsewhere either in conference or journal and should be
12 - 16 pages (LNCS style). Papers selected after peer review will be included in the 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science published by Springer (only after completing registration
) and presented orally (except unavoidable circumtances-like finencial constraints) 
at the conference.?

Publication?

All contributions will be reviewed by international program committee members and judged on
their quality and relevance. The accepted papers for SEPA 2019 will be published in Lecture
Notes in Computer Science as a book series of Computational Science and Its Applications: 
ICCSA. Please note that one of the authors of the accepted paper must be registered and 
supposed to present the paper in the conference (virtual presentation is allowed for 
authors who cannot attend the conference). The extended version of selected papers will 
also be invited for the publication in several journals (All Web of Science and SCOPUS 
indexed journals) including best papers in SCIE indexed journal*.?

*A special issue of a SCIE Journal- Information Technology And Controlis is confirmed 
for best papers of the software engineering symposiums(SEPA &amp; ISSQ) and workshop(TTSDP)@ICCSA 2019).
