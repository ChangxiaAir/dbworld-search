  <p>The international <strong>Conference on Learning Information Literacy across the Globe</strong> will be held on the 10th of May 2019 at DIPF, Frankfurt Main, Germany. The Conference is a final part of the Erasmus+ Project Information Literacy Online, a European project to improve students¡¯ competencies.</p> 
  <p>In November 2016 the EU project ILO was started with the aim to develop, evaluate and disseminate a multilingual open access online course (MOOC) designed to improve students¡¯ abilities to cope with the claims of present-day information society. In May 2019, the seven partner institutions will be able to present a MOOC on Information Literacy, covering six language and cultural areas. An integrated assessment component will enhance the autonomous learning progress.</p> 
  <p>The Conference will be a forum for the exchange of research and experience associated with Information Literacy (IL) Learning. Besides three keynotes and a panel, several tracks of paper sessions are planned. Submissions to the following topics of interest are invited:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>IL as a learning process, including assessment</li> 
   <li>Digital learning resources for IL (e.g. MOOCs, Learning-scenarios, OERs)</li> 
   <li>Comparative studies of courses and curricula with an IL lens</li> 
   <li>Cultural diversity of IL</li> 
   <li>IL in connection with other literacy concepts</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Many disciplines can contribute: Library and Information Science, different Learning Sciences, or Research in Cultural Diversity.</p> 
  <p>The Proceedings of the conference will be published digitally by the 10th of June.</p>
