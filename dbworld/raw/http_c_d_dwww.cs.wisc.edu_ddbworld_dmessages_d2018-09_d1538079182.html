  <p><strong>The Second IEEE International Workshop on Benchmarking, Performance Tuning and Optimization for Big Data Applications (BPOD 2018)</strong></p> 
  <p>Collocated with IEEE BigData 2018</p> 
  <p>One day during December 10-13, 2018, Seattle, WA, USA</p>

  <p>=============================================</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Users of big data are often not computer scientists. On the other hand, it is nontrivial for even experts to optimize&nbsp;performance&nbsp;of big data applications because there are so many decisions to make. For example, users have to first choose from many different big data systems and optimization algorithms to deal with complex structured data, graph data, and streaming data. In particular, there are numerous parameters to tune to optimize&nbsp;performance&nbsp;of a specific system and it is often possible to further optimize the algorithms previously written for "small" data in order to effectively adapt them in a big data environment. To make things more complex, users may worry about not only computational running time, storage cost and response time or throughput, but also&nbsp;quality&nbsp;of results, monetary cost, security and privacy, and energy efficiency. In more traditional algorithms and relational databases, these complexities are handled by query optimizer and other automatic tuning tools (e.g., index selection tools) and there are benchmarks to compare&nbsp;performance&nbsp;of different products and optimization algorithms. Such tools are not available for big data environment and the problem is more complicated than the problem for traditional relational databases.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>The aim of this workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners together to better understand the problems of optimization and performance tuning in a big data environment, to propose new approaches to address such problems, and to develop related benchmarks, tools&nbsp;and&nbsp;best practices.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Topics of interests include, but are not limited to:</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>- Theoretical and empirical performance model for big data applications</p> 
  <p>- Optimization for Machine Learning and Data Mining in big data</p> 
  <p>- Benchmark and comparative studies for big data processing and analytic platforms</p> 
  <p>- Monitoring, analysis, and visualization of performance in&nbsp;big&nbsp;data environment</p> 
  <p>- Workflow/process management &amp; optimization in&nbsp;big&nbsp;data environment</p> 
  <p>- Performance tuning and optimization for specific big data platforms or applications (e.g., No-SQL databases, graph processing systems, stream systems, SQL-on-Hadoop databases)</p> 
  <p>- Performance tuning and optimization for specific data sets (e.g., scientific data,&nbsp;spatio&nbsp;data, temporal data, text data, images, videos, mixed datasets)</p> 
  <p>- Case studies and best practices for performance tuning for big data</p> 
  <p>- Cost model and performance prediction in&nbsp;big&nbsp;data environment</p> 
  <p>- Impact of security/privacy settings on&nbsp;performance&nbsp;of big data systems</p> 
  <p>-&nbsp;Self adaptive&nbsp;or automatic tuning tools for big data applications</p> 
  <p>- Big data application optimization on&nbsp;High Performance&nbsp;Computing (HPC) and Cloud&nbsp;environments</p>
