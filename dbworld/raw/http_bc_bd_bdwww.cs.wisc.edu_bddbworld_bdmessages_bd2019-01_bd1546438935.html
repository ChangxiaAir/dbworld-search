Munich, Germany
17 - 19 September 2019
Special event: BIGCHEM (http://bigchem.eu) final meeting
============================================================

The International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN) is the annual flagship conference of the European Neural Network Society (ENNS). 
In 2019 the Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health GmbH (HMGU) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) together with the "Big Data in Chemistry" Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network European Industrial Doctorate project (BIGCHEM) organize the 28th ICANN Conference from the 17th to the 19th of September 2019 in Munich, Germany.

CONFERENCE TOPICS
ICANN 2019 is a dual-track conference featuring tracks in Brain Inspired Computing and Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks, with strong cross-disciplinary interactions and applications. All research fields dealing with Neural Networks will be present at the conference. A non-exhaustive list of topics includes:

Machine Learning:  Deep Learning, Neural Network Theory, Neural Network Models, Graphical Models, Bayesian Networks, Kernel Methods, Generative Models, Information Theoretic Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Relational Learning, Dynamical Models Recurrent Networks.

Brain Inspired Computing: Cognitive models, Computational Neuroscience, Self-organisation, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Control and Planning, Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Architectures, Neural Dynamics. 

Neural Applications for: Bioinformatics, Biomedicine, Intelligent Robotics, Neurorobotics, Language Processing, Image Processing, Sensor Fusion, Pattern Recognition, Data Mining, Neural Agents, Brain-Computer Interaction, Neural Hardware, Evolutionary Neural Networks.

Special session (BIGCHEM): Big Data analysis in chemistry,  chemoinformatics, use of deep learning to predict molecular properties, drug-discovery, modelling and prediction of chemical reaction data, synthetic route prediction, structure generation, molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry.
  

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTED SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATIONS
All scientific communications presented at ICANN 2019 will be reviewed and scientifically evaluated by a panel of experts. The conference will feature three categories of communications:
- oral communications (15'+5')
- poster communications
- demonstrations

Call for Special Sessions: 
ICANN2019 organizers cordially invite internationally recognised experts to organise Special Sessions (including workshops and competitions) within the general scope of the conference. Special Session Proposal request should be sent to icann2019@bigchem.eu 

Call for Papers: 
Authors willing to present original contributions in either oral or poster category may submit:
- a proceedings paper manuscript of about 10 - 12 pages to be published in Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series with individual DOI
- extended abstracts of a maximum length of 2 pages to be published in Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
The number of oral slots is limited.  In case the number of requested oral presentations is larger than the available slots the ICANN scientific committee will select which papers will be reassigned to a poster session.  This selections will be based on the coherence of the programme and is totally independent of the category of submission.
Submission of communications will be online. More details will be made available soon on the conference website: http://icann2019.org
