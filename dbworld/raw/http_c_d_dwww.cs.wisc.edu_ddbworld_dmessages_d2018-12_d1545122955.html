---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In conjunction with ESWC 20?19, 2nd-6th June 2019, Portoro?, Slovenia

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Workshop Overview

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Over the past years there has been a rapid growth in the use and the
importance of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) along with their application to
many important tasks. KGs are large networks of real-world entities
described in terms of their semantic types and their relationships to
each other. On the other hand, Deep Learning methods have also become an
important area of research, achieving some important breakthrough in
various research fields, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and Image Recognition.

In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical
that the communities related to Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP
join their forces in order to develop more effective algorithms and
applications.

This workshop, in the wake of other similar efforts at previous Semantic
Web conferences such as ESWC2018 and ISWC2018, aims to reinforce the
relationships between these communities and foster inter-disciplinary
research in the areas of KG, Deep Learning, and Natural Language
Processing.
