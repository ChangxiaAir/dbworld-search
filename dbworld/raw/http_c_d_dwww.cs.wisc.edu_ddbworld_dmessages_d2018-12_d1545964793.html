Our vision of this PhD Symposium at ICTERI is to provide an expert environment for the presentation of ideas and early results of PhD projects or other research aiming at receiving a PhD. 
Young researchers, who will join us to take part in discussions and/or present their papers, will be offered an opportunity to exchange and discuss their research ideas with their peers, supervisors, and senior scientists working in the fields that are within the scope of ICTERI 2019.

We solicit extended abstracts or short papers that present and justify PhD projects, or report the early results of PhD projects in addition to the presentation of the project. The presentations of early results are encouraged as these help prove the validity of the project and chosen approach. Topically, a submission should fit into the PhD Symposium scope outlined above. 
All submissions shall be annotated by the key words/phrases freely chosen by the authors. At least three and at most five key phrases have to be provided. All submissions must comply with the Guidelines for Springer Computer Science Conference authors (<a href="http://www.springer.com/de/it-informatik/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">http://www.springer.com/de/it-informatik/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>) as explained at the ICTERI 2019 formatting instructions (<a href="http://icteri.org/icteri-2019/formatting-instructions/">http://icteri.org/icteri-2019/formatting-instructions/</a>) page.

Extended abstracts or short papers are the only admissible submission types for the PhD Symposium at ICTERI. 
Evaluation focuses on originality, technical correctness, and the value of the planned or early results in a short to mid-term perspective. 
Page limit: not less than 4 and not more than 6 CCIS pages for an extended abstract and not less than 6 and not more that 10 CCIS pages for a short paper. 
It is required that the first author of any paper submitted for PhD Symposium at ICTERI is either a student at PhD or MSci level or a young researcher from industry who is working towards obtaining a PhD. The scientific advisor may be involved as the last author of a submission if deemed appropriate. Other authors may be listed only if they: (i) provide valuable inputs to the presented PhD project; and (ii) are external to the organization where the first author comes from. The organizers reserve the right to reject, without a review, a submission that does not comply with these authorship constraints.
