  <br> The Prot¨¦g¨¦ Short Course offers a 3-day intensive training in use of the Prot¨¦g¨¦ toolset, ontology development, and OWL. We cover best practices in ontology building and the latest Semantic Web technologies, including OWL 2, RDF, and SPARQL. We also cover topics such as real-world applications with ontologies, and data access and import from different data sources. The course is hands-on and is taught by the members of the Prot¨¦g¨¦ team.
