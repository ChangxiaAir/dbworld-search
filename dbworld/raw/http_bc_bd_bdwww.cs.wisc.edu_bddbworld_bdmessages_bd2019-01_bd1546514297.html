** CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS **

VLDB PhD workshops are a unique opportunity for graduate students to present and discuss their research work in the context of a premier international conference. In 2019, the VLDB Phd Workshop will take place on August 26th, 2019 in Los Angeles, California, co-located with the main VLDB conference. The workshop provides a forum that facilitates interactions among PhD students and stimulates feedback from more experienced researchers.

VLDB 2019 welcomes submissions from PhD students at any stage of their PhD work. If you are in the early stages of your studies, the submission should clearly describe the problem focused on, explain why it is important, detail why the existing solutions are not sufficient, and give an outline of the new solutions that are pursued. If you are in the middle or close to completion, the submission should be more concrete in describing your contribution, but still in the context of the doctoral work.

** IMPORTANT DATES **

- Submission Deadline: April 15, 2019 (5 p.m. PST)
- Notification: May 20, 2019
- Camera-ready copy: June 10, 2019

** SUBMISSION GUIDELINES **

Submissions must be single-author, and the name of the supervisor must be clearly marked ("supervised by") on the paper, under the authors name.

The paper should be no longer than 4 pages (including references) and should be formatted with the same rules as VLDB papers. You will find these rules summarized on the VLDB conference web:

    <A HREF="http://vldb.org/2019/?formatting-guidelines">http://vldb.org/2019/?formatting-guidelines</A> 

It is fine if specific portions of the thesis work have been published or submitted for publication; the page limit is 4 pages, so this does not constitute a duplicate submission to VLDB.

Authors should submit their papers in PDF format through the CMT conference management system:

** REVIEW PROCESS **

The review and decision of acceptance will balance many factors. This includes the quality of your proposal, and where you are within your doctoral education program. It also includes external factors, such as ensuring that as a group the accepted candidates exhibit a diversity of backgrounds and topics.

Candidates who have a clearly developed idea, who are formally considered by their institution to be working on their dissertation, and who still have time to be influenced by participation in the PhD Workshop will receive the strongest consideration.

** PROGRAM CHAIRS **

Ilaria Bartolini, University of Bologna
Feifei Li, University of Utah
