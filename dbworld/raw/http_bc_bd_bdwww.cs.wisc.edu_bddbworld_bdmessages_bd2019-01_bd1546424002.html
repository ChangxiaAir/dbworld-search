The Cloud Computing paradigm, marked by the self-service approach and the pay-per-use price model, has been applied in many different contexts: Internet of things, Big Data, Fog Computing, Software Defined Networks. However, no matter the underlying provisioning technology, the quality of service (QoS), expressed, for example, in terms of security, reliability, service continuity, responsiveness, maintenance, support,  is still a big concern for both the academia and the industry: the growth in the number and type of services offered to customers is not always reciprocated by the capability to grant a satisfactory quality level on the delivered services. 
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are the recognized solution to address such an issue is. But, due to the limited capability of CSP to offer clear measurable grants on the delivered quality, SLAs are very limited, consisting only of natural language description of grants. As a matter of fact, on the one side, CSPs are not able to offer measurable grants over the target services and on the other side Customers have no tools to measure and evaluate the quality of delivered services.
The workshop welcomes submissions offering research results, experimental solutions, case studies, and best practices. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

Innovative Methodologies: 
- Innovative QoS models
- SLA models and languages 
- Security SLAs
- Security metrics
- Quality metrics
- Measurement technologies
- Quality metrics prediction
- Customer-oriented quality verification
- Quality-Cost prediction models
- Blockchain and Smart Contracts for SLAs
- Standards and specification for cloud services' integration

Problem Specific Solutions: 
- Cloud/IoT/Big Data/Fog/SDNs security and quality metrics
- Data security across multiple domains
- QoS and SLA in Big Data Services

Case Studies and Experimental Solutions: 
- Adoption of SLA in Cloud/IoT/Big Data/Fog/SDNs
- Evaluation of Cloud architectures
- Quantitative Security Assessment of Cloud/IoT/Big Data/Fog/SDNs
- Quantitative evaluation of Industrial Experiences
- SLAs in Industrial case studies

Submission Guidelines:
We invite original research papers that have not been previously published and are not currently under review for publication elsewhere. Submitted papers should be no longer than 8 pages in two-column IEEE proceeding format.
The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates for conferences can be found at IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings at http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html.
