  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I am happy to announce that the December, 2018 issue of the Data
Engineering Bulletin is now available electronically via the IEEE
Computer Society Bulletin web site
<a href="http://tab.computer.org/tcde/bull_about.html">http://tab.computer.org/tcde/bull_about.html</a>. The ISSUES pages are
maintained both at the IEEE Computer Society
(<a href="http://sites.computer.org/debull/bull_issues.html">http://sites.computer.org/debull/bull_issues.html</a> ) and at Microsoft
(<a href="ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/debull/bull_issues.html">ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/debull/bull_issues.html</a> ). 

Joseph E Gonzalez served as editor for this issue, which is on
¡°Machine Learning Life-cycle Management.¡± 

This issue also witnesses a historical event: It begins with the
farewell letter from David Lomet, who served as the EIC for the
Bulletin for 26 years, during which he oversaw 103 issues of the
Bulletin. As I mention in my letter that follows, this itself is a
phenomenal record worth an extra-special celebration. David, thank you
so much for your contribution to the Bulletin and to the broad
database community!

As the new EIC for this important journal, I look forward to working
with all of you on the future issues of the Bulletin.
