**********************************************************************************

Databases are present in almost every IT system and collect data describing many areas of human lives and human activity. Collecting and processing of an increasing number of data makes it necessary to use computer architectures and data structures providing high performance and high availability of database systems. Moreover, a vast majority of data require appropriate processing and searching algorithms in order to make the data readable for users and to discover the knowledge that is hidden inside the data.

Beyond Databases, Architectures and Structures (BDAS) is a series of conferences that intends to give the state-of-the-art of the research that satisfies the needs of modern, widely understood database systems, architectures, models, structures, and algorithms focused on processing various types of data. The aim of the conference is to reflect the most recent developments of databases and allied techniques used for solving problems in a variety of areas related to database systems, or even go one step forward - beyond the horizon of existing databases, architectures and data structures.

- Stream databases
- Multidimensional databases
- Distributed databases
- Fuzzy databases
- Object-oriented databases
- Catalog databases
- Temporal and spatial databases
- Mobile databases
- XML and semi-structured data

Designing, formal models and database usage
- Query languages and optimization
- Metadata management
- Data management in cloud computing
- UML in designing databases
- Performance of data processing
- Protocols, security and control of data integrity

Algorithms, data exploration and knowledge bases
- Knowledge bases
- Expert systems and artificial intelligence
- Data mining and knowledge discovery
- Data extraction and data integration
- Image and music processing
- Fuzzy sets and rough sets
- Ontologies
- Multi-agent systems
- Social networks

Database systems and applications
- Databases in the Web
- Databases in management and production (MRPII/ERP/PLM)
- Business Intelligence
- Databases in bioinformatics and biomedicine
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- New applications, systems and usage areas


Paper Submission
----------------------------------------
We would like to invite you to submit a paper to the BDAS Conference. Submitted papers should be prepared in English in LNCS/LNAI style and should not exceed 15 pages (12 recommended).
