The University of Oulu Graduate School (UniOGS) (http://www.oulu.fi/uniogs/) provides the framework and conditions for high-quality, research-driven doctoral education at the University of Oulu, and field-specific doctoral training is provided by its multidisciplinary doctoral programmes. Infotech (http://www.oulu.fi/infotech/) offers a high-level international multidisciplinary environment supplied with cutting-edge infrastructures.&nbsp; Under this framework, the Information Technology and Electrical Engineering Doctoral Programme (ITEE-DP) (http://www.oulu.fi/uniogs/dp/iteedp) offers doctoral training in Electrical Engineering, Communications Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering and Information Processing Science.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1">Applications are invited for a full-time doctoral student position starting at the earliest on 01.01.2019 in an Academy of Finland project managed by Dr. Xiang Su in the Center for Ubiquitous Computing research unit, Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering. A trial period of 6 months is applied in the position.</span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our work aims to study 5G edge computing architecture moving computations from the central cloud infrastructure to the edges of 5G networks. We focus on novel edge architectures to handle vast amounts of data and provide high performance and quality to Moboile Augumented Reality (MAR), especially for the most latency-sensitive operations such as mapping, tracking and rendering. The architecture will also enhance the MAR flow with context metadata, handle knowledge synchronization between the cloud and edge nodes, and manage virtualization technologies in edge nodes. The position is supervised by Dr. Xiang Su and work closely with Prof. Pan Hui¡¯s team in University of Helsinki and Prof. Mika Ylianttila¡¯s team in CWC, Oulu.</span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Requirements for a doctoral student</b></span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1">Candidates should have a MSc in one of the following fields: computer science, communications, mathematics, statistics or another relevant subject by the time of the start date; proven ability to publish in top conference proceedings and journals; and a clear and well-developed strategy for outstanding future research that has the potential to result in world-leading publications.</span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Salary</b></span></p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1">The salary of the selected doctoral student will be set on levels 2 ¨C 4 of the national salary scale for the teaching and research staff of Finnish universities.
